# SCRABBLE-CLUB

A scrabble club requires a system to store members’ information and provide leader boards to show their top performing players.

For members we would want to store information such as the date they joined the club and their contact details.

All recorded scrabble games are head to head matches between 2 players, the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

You should provide, in order of priority:

Database schema definition (create table statements) for your solution
A member’s profile screen showing their
number of wins
number of losses
their average score
their highest score, when and where it was scored, and against whom
Interfaces (preferably browser based) to create and edit members’ details, such as name, contact number etc.
A leader board screen to list the members with the top 10 average scores, for those members who have played at least 10 matches.

-I have implemented this using python GUI and MYSQL
